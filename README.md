# Unsupervised-classification-of-driving-manoeuvres-using-self-organizing-maps
This work proposes an unsupervised method to classify highway driving manoeuvres using the self-organizing map (SOM). The SOM is an excellent method during the initial phase of data mining, it projects high dimensional input space onto the low dimensional regular map of nodes that can be effectively utilized to visualize, classify, cluster, and explore properties of the data. The low dimensionality of the resulting map allows for a graphical presentation of the data which can be easily interpreted by humans. This project uses multivariate time-series data collected over highways and it has pre-processed using min-max scaling and fed into the SOM algorithm to train an artificial neural network. This work is a collection of series of experiments in which it has been attempted to visualize clusters using distance maps, cluster maps, and the model is validated using the validation data set.
